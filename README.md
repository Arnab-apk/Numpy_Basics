## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository is a **complete learning guide** for mastering **NumPy** — from the most basic array operations to advanced mathematical computations, broadcasting, and vectorization.

Whether you’re a **beginner exploring numerical computing** or an **experienced Python developer** optimizing data-heavy workflows, this repo has you covered with **step-by-step implementations and practical examples.**

NumPy Introduction and Necessity 🌟
The video begins by explaining what NumPy (Numerical Python) is and why it's a fundamental library for fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and Data Analytics.

The Problem with Python Lists
The video highlights the limitations of standard Python when handling large datasets:

Slow Operations: Python is very slow when dealing with large amounts of data, especially when using loops for mathematical operations.

Memory Inefficiency: Python's built-in lists are not memory-efficient, making it difficult to handle huge datasets smoothly.

Example: A practical example of a scientist analyzing temperatures from one million cities demonstrates how slow a simple loop-based calculation is with a Python list.

The NumPy Solution
NumPy was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005 to solve these problems.

Core Goals: To enable Python to handle large-scale numerical data quickly and to perform fast calculations without using slow Python loops.

The Power of Arrays: NumPy introduces a special data structure called arrays, which are super fast and memory-efficient.

Example: The same temperature calculation is performed using NumPy's np.mean() function, showing a much faster and more efficient solution without any loops.

Key Features and Applications of NumPy 🚀
The video details the main advantages and real-world uses of NumPy.

What is NumPy?
Definition: NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It's a Python library that helps handle large amounts of numerical data efficiently using arrays.

Key Benefits of NumPy
Speed: NumPy is 50-100 times faster than regular Python lists.

Less Memory Usage: It uses less RAM, allowing for smooth processing of even the largest datasets.

Easy Math Operations: It simplifies complex mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, mean, max, and minimum.

Foundation of AI & ML: It is the foundational library for the AI and ML ecosystem, with many other libraries built on top of it.

Real-World Applications
Data Science & Analytics: Used for analyzing and processing large datasets.

Machine Learning & AI: Used in AI models like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Stock Market & Finance: Helps in analyzing trends and predicting stock prices.

Medical Research: Used for analyzing DNA sequences and detecting diseases.

Image Processing: Used in tools like Photoshop and OpenCV for image editing.

Industry Use: Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon heavily rely on NumPy.

Array Creation and Types in NumPy 🛠
The video explains how to create NumPy arrays and introduces different array dimensions.

Array Types
1D Array: A list of numbers stored in a single row. The video provides a simple example.

2D Array: A table with rows and columns. It's also referred to as a matrix. An example of creating a 2x3 matrix is shown.

Multi-Dimensional Arrays (3D, etc.): Arrays with more than two dimensions, often used in advanced applications like deep learning.

Methods to Create Arrays
From Python Lists: Use np.array() to convert a Python list into a NumPy array.

With Default Values:

np.zeros(shape): Creates an array filled with zeros.

np.ones(shape): Creates an array filled with ones.

np.full(shape, value): Creates an array and fills it with a specific value.

Sequences of Numbers:

np.arange(start, stop, step): Works like Python's range() but returns a NumPy array.

Identity Matrix:

np.eye(size): Creates a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

NumPy Array Properties and Operations 📊
This section covers how to inspect and manipulate arrays.

Checking Array Properties
array.shape: Returns the dimensions of the array (rows, columns).

array.size: Returns the total number of elements in the array.

array.ndim: Returns the number of array dimensions (1 for 1D, 2 for 2D, etc.).

array.dtype: Returns the data type of the array's elements (e.g., int64, float64).

Modifying Arrays
Changing Data Type: Use array.astype(new_type) to convert the data type of an array's elements.

Element-wise Math Operations: NumPy allows direct, fast mathematical operations on entire arrays without loops. arr + 5, arr * 2, etc.

Aggregation Functions: Built-in functions to summarize data. Examples include:

np.sum(): Adds all elements.

np.mean(): Calculates the average.

np.min(): Finds the smallest value.

np.max(): Finds the largest value.

np.std(): Calculates standard deviation.

np.var(): Calculates variance.

Indexing, Slicing, and Reshaping 🔪
These are crucial concepts for selecting and manipulating array data.

Indexing and Slicing
Indexing: Selecting a single element from an array using its position. NumPy uses zero-based indexing and supports negative indexing to access elements from the end of the array.

Slicing: Selecting a subset of an array using [start:stop:step] syntax.

Fancy Indexing: Selecting multiple, non-sequential elements at once by passing a list of indices.

Boolean Masking (Filtering): Filtering elements based on a condition, which is much faster than using loops. For example, arr[arr > 25] will return all elements greater than 25.

Reshaping and Flattening
Reshaping: Changing the dimensions of an array without changing its data.

array.reshape(rows, columns): Reshapes a 1D array into a 2D array, for example. The total number of elements must remain the same.

Flattening: Converting a multi-dimensional array back into a 1D array.

array.ravel(): Returns a "view" of the original array, meaning changes to the new array will affect the original.

array.flatten(): Returns a "copy," so the original array remains unchanged.

Modifying and Combining Arrays 🔄
This section covers adding, removing, and joining arrays.

Adding Elements: NumPy arrays have a fixed size, so adding elements creates a new array.

np.insert(): Inserts an element at a specific index.

np.append(): Adds an element to the end of an array.

Joining Arrays:

np.concatenate(): Joins two or more arrays along a specified axis.

Removing Elements:

np.delete(): Deletes an element from an array at a specific index, returning a new array.

Stacking Arrays:

np.vstack(): Stacks arrays vertically (row-wise).

np.hstack(): Stacks arrays horizontally (column-wise).

Splitting Arrays:

np.split(): Splits an array into multiple sub-arrays.

np.hsplit(): Splits an array horizontally.

np.vsplit(): Splits an array vertically.

Broadcasting and Vectorization ⚡
The video explains how NumPy performs operations on arrays of different shapes.

Broadcasting: A mechanism that allows NumPy to perform mathematical operations on arrays with different shapes. It automatically "expands" a smaller array to match the shape of a larger one. The video explains three rules of broadcasting: matching dimensions, expanding single elements, and incompatible shapes (which cause an error).

Vectorization: Applying an operation to an entire array at once, without explicit loops. This is a key reason why NumPy is so fast. The video shows a comparison of a Python loop vs. a vectorized NumPy operation, demonstrating NumPy's superior speed.

Handling Missing Values (Data Cleaning Project) 🧹
The video concludes with a practical data cleaning project, demonstrating how to handle real-world data issues.

The Problem with Real-World Data
Real-world datasets often have missing values (NaN), incorrect values (e.g., negative salary), or unrealistic values (outliers).

Such data can cause problems for mathematical calculations and machine learning models.

NumPy's Solutions for Missing Values
np.isnan(): Detects missing values (NaN). It returns a boolean array (True where a NaN is found).

np.nan_to_num(): Replaces NaN values with a specific number (by default, 0).

np.isinf(): Detects infinite values, which can result from operations like dividing by zero.

Data Cleaning Project
The video uses a real-world "Indian Employee Dataset" to demonstrate data cleaning using both Pandas and NumPy. The project covers:

Loading the Dataset: Using Pandas to load a CSV file.

Checking for Missing Values: Using df.isnull().sum() to count missing values per column.

Handling Missing Values: Replacing missing values in the 'Salary' and 'Performance Rating' columns with the mean or median of the respective columns.

Handling Infinite Values: Identifying and replacing infinite values with a number using NumPy functions.

Handling Duplicate Records: Removing duplicate employee entries.

Handling Negative and Outlier Values: Removing negative salaries and extremely high, unrealistic salaries using statistical methods like standard deviation to define a realistic range.

Saving the Cleaned Data: Saving the processed data into a new CSV file.

The project effectively summarizes all the concepts taught in the video, showing their practical application in a real-world scenario.
